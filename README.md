## Vision Transformer - Pytorch + Lightning

Forked from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch">https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch</a>.

Final project for DS-3001, Computer Vision, by Ilana Weinstein and Noah Kasmanoff

Implementation of the <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy">Vision Transformer</a>, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in Pytorch with easy logging and training routines implemented in Pytorch-Lightning.
